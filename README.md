# Find Quotient and Remainder
## C Program that could find out and Compute Quotient and Remainder in a division operation  

### Test Case as output in this program

#### Case: 1
##### Enter dividend: 49
##### Enter divisor: 0
##### Undefined
##### Can not divide by zero
<br/>
#### Case: 2
##### Enter dividend: 25
##### Enter divisor: 5
##### Quotient = 5
##### Remainder = 0
<br/>
#### Case: 3
##### Enter dividend: 23
##### Enter divisor: 7
##### Quotient = 3
##### Remainder = 2

### How does this program work?
<br/>
In this program, the user is asked to enter two integers (dividend and divisor). They have stored in variables **dividend** and **divisor** respectively.
<br/>
If the user gives input zero in the divisor stage then the program will execute. Because numbers can not be divided zero in math.
<br/>
Then the quotient is evaluated using / (the division operator), and stored in **quotient**
<br/>
Similarly, the remainder is evaluated using % (the modulo operator) and stored in the **remainder**
<br/>
**Finally, the quotient and remainder are displayed as output**
